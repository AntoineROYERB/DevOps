# DevOps
![alt text](Course/devops.png)

This repository is dedicated to showcasing the work carried out during the DevOps course conducted by the company Takima in collaboration with EPF (École Polytechnique Féminine). In this introduction, we will briefly explore the concept of DevOps and provide links to the various README.md files present in this repository.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a software development approach aimed at bringing together development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to promote collaboration and process automation. DevOps is based on the following principles:

- **Collaboration**: Dev and Ops teams work closely together to ensure continuous delivery and high-quality software.

- **Automation**: Repetitive tasks are automated, speeding up development, testing, and deployment.

- **Monitoring and Feedback**: The application is continuously monitored, enabling quick issue identification and feedback collection for continuous improvement.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Infrastructures are managed as code, facilitating deployment and environment management.

DevOps relies on the adoption of specific practices and tools, including continuous integration (CI), continuous deployment (CD), configuration management, and virtualization, among others.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the work completed during the DevOps course delivered by Takima at EPF. Each project or exercise is documented in a specific README.md file. You can access these files to learn more about each project. Here is a list of the projects in this repository:


1. [TP1 - Docker](TP1/README.md)

    In this project, we focused on the essential principles of Docker, including containerization and container management.

2. [TP2 - Github Actions](TP2/README.md)

    The second project delves into continuous deployment using Github Actions and demonstrates how it simplifies infrastructure management and automation.

3. [TP3 - Ansible](TP3/README.md)

   The third project introduces Ansible, a powerful automation tool, and delves into its applications for configuration management and orchestration in DevOps workflows.

Each README.md contains specific details about the project objectives, technologies used, and results achieved.

Feel free to explore the different projects to learn more about the DevOps practices and tools we studied as part of this course. DevOps is a continuously evolving discipline, and these projects illustrate how it can be applied to enhance collaboration and efficiency in software development.

What is it supposed to do?

`mvn clean verify` is a command used in Apache Maven to clean and verify (build and test) a Java project. It removes files generated in previous builds (the "clean" phase) and performs a full project build, including compilation, running tests, and generating artifacts (the "verify" phase). This is commonly used to ensure a clean and reliable build of a Java project.
